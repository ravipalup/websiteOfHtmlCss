                        <h4>Quick Food</h4>
                        <p id="pid">Life today has become quick and way of life changes have made individuals dependent on food and eatables that can be promptly made. Fast food is the name authored for such food things which are either pre-cooked or can be cooked in lesser time than ordinary food.
                            Individuals think that it is advantageous to eat such food things which please the taste buds more than standard food. They contain more salts, sugar and no or extremely less dietary fibre except for having flavours that make them more agreeable. Fast food things have no health benefit and are incredibly unfortunate.
